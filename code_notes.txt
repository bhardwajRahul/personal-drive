dir deletion logic:

we send info that the thing to del is dir
- delete where s3key matches key sent && is_dir -> this delete the dir entry in db
- get all rows from db where path like key_sent% (starts with the folder) -> get s3key -> delete -> delete rows db

study:
- Laravel validation study
- $fileName = $_FILES['files']['full_path'][$fileIndex]; validate this
- Laravel/phpstorm format
	: remove unnecessary use statements
- testing . Establish this.
- xdebug instructions for wsl2
- Laravel: avoid auth/user everywhere
- have a response wrapper class ? for success response and error response ?


path:

The S3 logic is as follow:
"" -> everything
"folder/" -> get everything recursively in "/folder/"
"basedir/folder/" ->get from /basedir/folder"

So beginning is "/" always implied
