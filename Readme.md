## Installation:
### Use from Docker Hub 
Personal Drive is hosted on Docker Hub. Please read the following carefully, as the below config will need changes for your setup.

Make a new directory, cd into it, then create a new file docker-compose.yml.
```bash
mkdir personaldrive ; cd personaldrive ; touch docker-compose.yml
```

Below is docker-compose.yml. Modify it in the following way:
- `/absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host` - Change to the location where you intend to save your data. **Make sure the directory is writable.** In my case, I had to give 777 permissions.

#### For Localhost 

```yaml
services:
  personal-drive:
    image: docker.io/personaldrive/personaldrive
    container_name: personal-drive
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host:/var/www/html/personal-drive-storage-folder
      - personal-drive-data:/var/www/html/personal-drive/database/db
    environment:
      DISABLE_HTTPS: true
volumes:
  personal-drive-data:
```
Run `docker compose up` 
Open http://localhost:8080

#### Server Instructions
- https://sub.yoursite.com - set your real site.
```
services:
  personal-drive:
    image: docker.io/personaldrive/personaldrive
    container_name: personal-drive
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host:/var/www/html/personal-drive-storage-folder
      - personal-drive-data:/var/www/html/personal-drive/database/db
    environment:
      APP_URL: https://sub.yoursite.com
volumes:
  personal-drive-data:
```
Run `docker compose up`

Next, we need a web server to point to this container.
Config depends on the web server. 
1. For **Caddy**, it's simple if we use reverse_proxy. It handles HTTPS automagically. Highly recommended for personal sites!
```caddy
sub.yoursite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
} 
```
The app will also be available on http://localhost:8080

### Regular Installation
Clone the repo and run the guided setup script.
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gyaaniguy/personal-drive.git
 cd personal-drive
 chmod +x setup.sh
 ./setup.sh
```

Ensure PHP and the web server allow large uploads.   
**It is vital that the `storage`, `bootstrap/cache`, and `database` folders are writable for the web server**. The setup script attempts to set these permissions.

---

## Configuration:
- ‚öôÔ∏è The storage folder can be changed from 'Settings'
- üìà Increasing upload limits is crucial and depends on your web server app - Apache, Nginx, Caddy. Detailed instructions are present on the 'Settings' page after app installation.
- üß† Increasing PHP and PHP-FPM (if used) memory limits is also crucial.
- üìù The following folders require write permissions:
```bash
storage
bootstrap/cache
database
```
The setup script adjusts permissions and ownership if provided with root access.

---

## Forgot Password: 
The admin password cannot be changed. This is done to reduce the attack surface. If you forget your password: 
- Reinstall the app OR delete the `database/db/database.sqlite` file -> This will remove all 'shares'
- Manually edit the password in the above database file

---

## Development:
Built with Laravel 11 and React. Inertia.js connects React components to the Laravel backend. Uses SQLite as the database.
PHP code follows PSR-12 standard.

### Extensive Testing. 

90% coverage has been achieved. This includes testing for various scenarios and branches.

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/gyaaniguy/personal-drive/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=DYLKB4SZVD)](https://codecov.io/github/gyaaniguy/personal-drive)

For local development, you may want to disable HTTPS. Change these in `.env`:
```env
DISABLE_HTTPS=true
APP_ENV=development
```
Then run:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear ; php artisan config:clear ; 
```

To build frontend components, run `npm run build ; npm run dev`

---

## Troubleshooting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Permissions are important!** I have improved error handling, so the app informs the user. But if you are getting unexpected errors, please ensure important directories have write permissions.
  - Data storage folder -> as set in settings. 
  - `./database` folder | `./database/db/database.sqlite` file
  - `./bootstrap/cache` 
  - `./storage` 
- üõ†Ô∏è **Large uploads failing:** PHP upload limits are annoyingly low.  
  - Edit `php.ini` 
```ini
; php.ini
upload_max_filesize = 1G
post_max_size = 1G
max_file_uploads = 10000
```
  - Nginx/Apache can also have their own limits. Caddy just works.

---

## Todo:
As of 18 April 2025, I have added several 'intermediate' level features. The next order of business is to ensure the app is bug-free and secure. Once I am satisfied with it, I'll have a v1 release.

#### Future Plans
These are just thoughts. Can't make any promises.
- Feature: Encryption. Vital, so the host can't read our files
- Feature: Improve search. Maybe in-content search, folder-specific. Maybe a special 'Notes' mode
- Feature: Collaboration. Perhaps a checkbox that allows guests to upload? 
- Feature: Save playback position checkbox 
- Feature: mp3/audio playback
- Feature: More previewable files - doc, docx, ppt. Unsure if this will be feasible.
