## Demo:
https://demo.personaldrive.xyz/

## Requirements:
- A server running PHP with sqlite, PHP composer, nodejs, npm.
- Sudo access for setting permissions.
- Webserver user name (if not www-data)
- Files for upload
- Friends to share files with

## Installation:
### Use from Docker Hub 
Personal Drive is hosted on docker hub.  Please read the following carefully, as below config will need changes for your setup.

Make a new directory, cd into it, then create a new file docker-compose.yml.
```bash
mkdir personaldrive ; cd personaldive ; touch docker-compose.yml
```

Below is docker-compose.yml. Modify it in the following way:
- /absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host - Change to the location where you intended to save your data. **Make sure it is writable.** In my case I had to give 777 permissions.

#### For Localhost 

```
services:
  personal-drive:
    image: docker.io/personaldrive/personaldrive
    container_name: personal-drive
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host:/var/www/html/personal-drive-storage-folder
      - personal-drive-data:/var/www/html/personal-drive/database
    environment:
      DISABLE_HTTPS: true
volumes:
  personal-drive-data:
```
Run `docker compose up` 
Open http://localhost:8080

#### Server Instructions
- https://sub.yoursite.com - set your real site.
```
services:
  personal-drive:
    image: docker.io/personaldrive/personaldrive
    container_name: personal-drive
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/store/data/on/host:/var/www/html/personal-drive-storage-folder
      - personal-drive-data:/var/www/html/personal-drive/database
    environment:
      APP_URL: https://sub.yoursite.com
volumes:
  personal-drive-data:
```
you will need a web-server to point to this container.
Config depends on the webserver. 
1. For **caddy**, its simple if we use reverse_proxy. It handles https automagically. Highly recommended for personal sites !
```
sub.yoursite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
} 
```
The app will also be available on http://localhost:8080 

### Regular Installation
Clone the repo and runs the guided setup script.
```bash
 git clone git@github.com:gyaaniguy/personal-drive.git
 cd personal-drive
 chmod +x setup.sh
 ./setup.sh
```

Ensure PHP and the webserver allow large uploads.   
**It is vital that the 'storage, bootstrap/cache and database' folders are writable for the webserver** . The setup script attempts to set these permissions.

 
Next :
- Set up your webserver to point your site to personal-drive/public
- Open the site and follow the on-screen wizard to create an admin account and set up the storage folder.



### Configuration:
- Storage folder can be changed from 'Settings'
- Increasing upload limits is crucial and depends on your web server app - apache, nginx, caddy. Detailed instructions are present on the 'settings' page after app installation.
- Increasing PHP and PHP-FPM (if used) memory limits is also crucial.
- The following folders require write permissions:
```bash
storage
bootstrap/cache
database
```
The setup script adjusts permissions and ownership if provided with root access

### Features:  

- Share files:
  - Password protection
  - Set expiration
  - Set custom URL
  - A sharing control panel, to pause and delete existing shares
- Media player. Slideshow:
  - Play and view images and videos
  - Preview text and pdf files
  - Keyboard shortcuts available during slideshow . Left, right, escape
- Files are indexed
- Dynamically generated thumbnails
- Upload multiple files or entire folders recursively
- Select one or all files in a folder
- Download, delete, share selected files
- Two layouts: list view and tile view
- Fast sort, even for thousands of files
- Breadcrumb navigation

### Development:
Built with Laravel 11 and React. Inertia.js connects React components to the Laravel backend. Uses SQLite as the database.
PHP code follows psr-12 standard
For local dev Please check the following env vars
```
DISABLE_HTTPS=true
APP_ENV=development
```
To build frontend components run `npm run build ; npm run dev`


### Forgot password: 
Admin Password cannot be changed. This is done to reduce attack surface. If you forget your password: 
- reinstall the app OR delete the `database/database.sqlite` file -> This will remove all 'shares'
- Manually edit the password in the above database file

### Known Issues:
- Files overwrite existing ones without rename options

### Todo:
- Drag and Drop Upload
- Rename Functionality
